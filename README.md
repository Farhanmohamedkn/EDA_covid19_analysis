# 🦠 COVID-19 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on trends in case numbers, deaths, recovery rates, and vaccination efforts across the world. The analysis uses publicly available datasets and visualizes key insights to understand the progression and impact of the pandemic.

# 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to:

Clean and preprocess COVID-19 case and vaccine data

Explore country-level and global trends

Analyze peak infection periods and mortality rates

Visualize vaccination rollouts and their correlation with case reductions

Identify patterns, anomalies, and high-impact periods

# 🧰 Tools & Technologies
Python

Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation

Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly – Data visualization

Jupyter Notebook – Interactive data analysis

Kaggle / OWID / Johns Hopkins CSSE – Data sources
